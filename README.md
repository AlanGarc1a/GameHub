# GameHub

GameHub is a single page web application where users can create, update, view, and delete the games they have played.

# Motivation

I have been using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to build user interfaces for web applications. I wanted to learn the Full Stack of Web applications
and so I decided to learn different technologies to use in order to build one. I decided to learn the MERN stack and built
this simple CRUD application where users can save theirfavorite games.
